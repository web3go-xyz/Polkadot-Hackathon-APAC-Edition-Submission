The problem Web3Go solves

Business models of the web3.0 era rely more than ever on data-driven decision making. While decision makers have a much higher degree of access to raw on-chain (and to a lesser degree off-chain) data, the sheer volume and abstraction of the data from the overarching use case, create artificial entry hurdles slowing adoption. The future of the fully decentralized internet will require decentralized and community driven data aggregators such as Web3Go as its sense-making foundation. Web3Go is the Google Analytics of Web3.0.

At Web3Go we are building the open data-analysis platform of the Polkadot ecosystem. Unlike other data aggregators of The Web3Go platform will incentivize both a community driven data query and dashboard creation and an institutional access and consumption of said analyses. We aim to serve the following two problem statements / user stories:

1. As a stakeholder of a parachain slot holder (the “Data Consumer”), I want to access tailor-made, real-time, data analyses and dashboards specific to the specific parachain’s use case in order to make data-driven decisions.
2. As a Web3Go community member (the “Data Producer”), I want to be rewarded for solving data analysis requests raised by the Data Consumer through the use of Web3Go’s data toolset in order to keep engagement with the platform and provide the best possible quality.

We are targeting at providing a high adaptive solution to all tech/non-tech users, making all communities in polkadot eco system capable of exploiting their valuable insight from data. Such solution includes but not limited to constant indexer service implementation adapted to parachains' change, on-chain DID database for extension of cross-chain data analysis, toolset for quick aggregation of data analysis result and so on.
